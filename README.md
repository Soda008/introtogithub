## Why Version Control Matters
Version control is essential for data projects because it creates a permanent change log, allowing you to track exactly who changed a model/dataset and why. It acts as a "ctrl+z", enabling you to instantly roll back to a previous functioning version if a new change breaks your data pipeline or produces unexpected results. It also facilitates seamless collaboration by allowing multiple team members to work on different features simultaneously without overwriting each other's code or losing progress.
